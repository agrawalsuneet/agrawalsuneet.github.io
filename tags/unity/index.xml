      <description>In continuation to my previous blog Native Android text sharing in Unity, where we learnt about sharing text from a Unity app targeting the Android platform, let&#39;s try to learn about how can we receive a text from other apps. Accepting a text from other apps is not that common but sometimes location-based games required to accept text or location shared from other apps. There can be a generic use case also where we want to accept some text from other apps for any purpose.</description>

      <description>The Android manifest file describes essential information about your app to the Android build tools, the Android operating system, and Google Play. Every Android app or unity app running on the Android platform must have a Manifest file. The manifest file contains information about package name, permissions, application name, icon, activities, services, providers and much more. Usually, Unity takes care of this manifest file generation and putting it in the right place but sometimes we need to add some custom tags to the final generated manifest file like adding intent-filters to the activity tag.</description>

      <description>While implementing native sharing using my previous post, Native Android image sharing in Unity we saw an exception “android.os.FileUriExposedException” in Android 8 (Oreo) and above. Since Google changed the sharing way using FileProvider to make it more secure, we can not share the file object directly to any other Application. We need to use the FileProvider and grant read URI permission to make it accessible for any other app. In this blog, will guide step by step to enable image sharing to any other app using FileProvider.</description>

      <description>While developing unity games in C# targeting android platform, we always want to use few native android features in our game. These features can be showing notifications on certain actions in the game or can be sharing the high score with other players and inviting them to try our game using android native share. Android gives us all the possibilities to achieve these native android functionalities in unity app using C#.</description>

      <description>In continuation to my previous blogs Native Android in Unity, will consider another example of native Android text sharing functionality in the unity app. This is a very common requirement in any unity app targeting Android platform to share the high score or challenge other players with a text message or a screenshot of the high score. The sharing can be done via any of the app available on the user’s device which supports sharing.</description>
